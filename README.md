# Formula One - Predicting Winners

## Problem Formulation

### Context:
Formula One generates vast amounts of data during races, including driver performance metrics, telemetry, pit stops, and weather conditions.

### Purpose:
This project aims to apply Business Intelligence (BI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to Formula One data to identify key performance indicators (KPIs) influencing race outcomes and predict future race winners and exciting race moments.

### Research Questions:
1. Which factors influence race outcomes in Formula One?
2. Can historical pit stop data be used to determine optimal pit stop windows based on varying parameters?
3. How do weather changes (e.g., rain, wind) impact race pace and pit stop strategy?
4. Can ML models accurately predict race winners and exciting race moments?

### Hypotheses:
1. Driver performance, race and lap times, qualifying times, and pit stop times significantly influence race outcomes.
2. Historical pit stop data can be leveraged to identify optimal pit stop windows based on track conditions and tire wear.
3. Weather changes have a significant impact on race pace and pit stop strategy.
4. ML models can predict race winners and exciting race moments with a high degree of accuracy.

### Annotation:
Analyzing Formula One data using BI and ML techniques offers an intriguing research goal due to the sport's rich dataset and potential for uncovering hidden insights. By predicting race winners and optimal pit stop strategies, this project aims to make Formula One data more actionable for stakeholders, including drivers, pit stop crews, PR departments, and viewers. The integration of BI and ML can enhance fan engagement and improve the overall experience of Formula One.

### Expected Solution:
The project's solution will provide actionable insights derived from Formula One data, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions to improve race performance and viewer engagement. The solution will benefit various categories of users, including drivers, pit stop crews, PR departments, and viewers interested in betting, race strategies, and exciting race moments.
